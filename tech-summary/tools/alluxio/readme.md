# Alluxio

[Apache Alluxio](https://www.alluxio.io/) is an open-sourced virtual distributed file system.  You could go to following links for understand what it is and what kind of thing it could do:
- [Alluxio: The Journey Thus Far and the Road ahead](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/alluxio/)
- [Building a Large-scale Interactive SQL Query Engine using Presto and Alluxio in JD.com](https://www.alluxio.io/blog/building-a-large-scale-interactive-sql-query-engine-using-presto-and-alluxio-in-jd-com/) [slides](https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/strata-eu-2018/public/schedule/detail/64692)

Highly recommend [Alluxio's Lab here](./lab.md).

## Best scenario
- Alluxio acted as cache layer for Hotspot.
- Alluxio hide data access between different data access, such as from cloud provider(S3, Azure file storage) or HDFS
- Alluxio not suggest for live data processing
