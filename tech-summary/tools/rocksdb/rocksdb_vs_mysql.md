# RocksDB vs MySQL

## MySQL

As internal storage engine of `MySQL`, `InnoDB` is great for performance and reliability, but there are some inefficiencies on space and write amplification with flash.

`redo log` belongs to `InnoDB`, records physical log, such as "modification on a data page"  
`binlog` belongs to `MySQL`, records all logic operation, such as "Add 1 to c where ID = 2", WAL

### Notes

- `InnoDB` write amplification
   + index values are stored in leaf nodes and sorted by keys, the database working set doesnâ€™t fit in memory and keys are updated in a random pattern.  Updating one row requires a number of page reads, makes several pages dirty, and forces many dirty pages to be written back to storage. 
   + In addition, `InnoDB` writes dirty pages to storage twice to support recovery from partial page writes on unplanned machine failure.

- `InnoDB` compression alignment results in extra unused space
