# The manager's path

By Camille Fournier

## Highlights

- <span style="color:#0000FF">&#9632;</span> Suggestions for speeding up shipping code and delivery iteration
   + Use strategy similar as debugging slow software system
       * Too many alerts or incidents that are causing the team to spend a lot of time firefighting?
       * Projects that are unclear or poorly specified?
       * Developer tools that don’t work well, slow builds, painful release processes, or other bottlenecks that slow down the act of writing code?
   + Understanding more about the team -> dig deeper
       *  Are there personality conflicts among team members that are causing tension?
       *  Is the team bogged down in a bunch of pointless meetings or bureaucracy? 
       *  Do they feel like their ideas aren’t being heard and demotivated by a culture that expects them to just churn out code without listening to the team’s feedback on what they could be working on? 

- <span style="color:#0000FF">&#9632;</span> Same question, suggestion from Jocelyn Goldfein for FB around 2010, about faster software shipment
    + move people around to unblock each other
    + enable feedback loops -> single branch -> use feature flags to enable/disable features
    + Good iterative process 
        * week 1 -> prototype, week 2 -> testing with facebook people, week 3 getting some form of external usage data, week 4 trying to polish and iterate on the thing learned.  At the end of week 4 prune the branch and start next iteration     


- <span style="color:#0000FF">&#9632;</span> Suggestions for new manager
   + Spend time getting to know your new team as individuals.  Team is important than project and technique.
   + Spend time to figure out what the group needs most from you.  Don't be anxious to manage.

- <span style="color:#0000FF">&#9632;</span> What are the main things that employees expect from their manager?
   + 1-1 meetings
       * to-do list
       * catch up
       * feedback
       * getting to know each other
   + feedback
   + resources for career growth
   + negative part, ways to improve, avoid sunrise

- As an employee, remember that ultimately, we’re all adults and responsible for our own destiny. That means that you should spend some time thinking about what you want for yourself, and what you want for your career. When you know what you want, you can go out and find it more easily, and you can ask your manager for what you want if you aren’t getting it.
