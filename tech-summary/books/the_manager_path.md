# The manager's path

By Camille Fournier

## Highlights

- <span style="color:#0000FF">&#9632;</span> Suggestions for speeding up shipping code and delivery iteration
   + Use strategy similar as debugging slow software system
       * Too many alerts or incidents that are causing the team to spend a lot of time firefighting?
       * Projects that are unclear or poorly specified?
       * Developer tools that don’t work well, slow builds, painful release processes, or other bottlenecks that slow down the act of writing code?
   + Understanding more about the team -> dig deeper
       *  Are there personality conflicts among team members that are causing tension?
       *  Is the team bogged down in a bunch of pointless meetings or bureaucracy? 
       *  Do they feel like their ideas aren’t being heard and demotivated by a culture that expects them to just churn out code without listening to the team’s feedback on what they could be working on? 

- <span style="color:#0000FF">&#9632;</span> Same question, suggestion from Jocelyn Goldfein for FB around 2010, about faster software shipment
    + move people around to unblock each other
    + enable feedback loops -> single branch -> use feature flags to enable/disable features
    + **Good iterative process** 
        * week 1 -> prototype, week 2 -> testing with facebook people, week 3 getting some form of external usage data, week 4 trying to polish and iterate on the thing learned.  At the end of week 4 prune the branch and start next iteration     


- <span style="color:#0000FF">&#9632;</span> Suggestions for new manager
   + Spend time getting to know your new team as individuals.  Team is important than project and technique.
   + Spend time to figure out what the group needs most from you.  Don't be anxious to manage.

- <span style="color:#0000FF">&#9632;</span> What are the main things that employees expect from their manager?
   + 1-1 meetings
       * to-do list
       * catch up
       * feedback
       * getting to know each other
   + feedback
   + resources for career growth
   + negative part, ways to improve, avoid sunrise

- As an employee, remember that ultimately, we’re all adults and responsible for our own destiny. That means that you should spend some time thinking about what you want for yourself, and what you want for your career. When you know what you want, you can go out and find it more easily, and you can ask your manager for what you want if you aren’t getting it.

## Chapter notes

### Chapter 1 - Management 101
- Your job as a manager is to get better outcomes from a group of people working together.
- It’s the realization that you don’t have to do everything yourself, be the best at everything, or even know how to do everything
- 3 things managers thing about every day: **people, purpose, and process**
- Moving to a managerial role means more focus on your team than yourself, more time with people, being a stable force for emotionally challenging situations
- You don’t need to be a manager to move up in organizations; “individual contributor” roles allow for specialized work without managerial tasks
- “What makes a good leader is that they eschew the spotlight in favor of spending time and energy to do what they need to do to support and protect their people.” …”In return, we offer our blood and sweat and tears and do everything we can to see our leader’s vision come to life.” - Simon Sinek, Leaders Eat Last
- Only when you have built trust with your reports will you have the credibility to help them achieve more together.

### Chapter 2 - Mentoring

- Some good questions for new hires:
    - What was more challenging than you expected?
    - What was easier than you expected?
- As the manager of a growing team, a mistake that many people make is continuing individual contributor work past the point at which it is sustainable
- Ways in which people become managers:
    - The Apprentice – Your manager’s team is growing, so you’ve been asked to manage a part of it going forward.
    - Pioneer – You are a founding member of a new group, and you’re now responsible for its growth
    - New Boss – You’re coming in to manage an already-established team, either within your existing organization or at a new one
    - Successor – Your manager has decided to leave, and you are taking his place
- **Listening is a precursor to empathy.**


### Chapter 3 - Leading a Small Team

- Managing a small team is about mastering the following basic fundaments: developing a healthy manager-report relationship and creating an environment of support.
- **Trust** is the most important ingredient for successful managers
- Reports should feel able to:
    - Bring their biggest challenges to managers
    - Give feedback that isn’t taken personally (Radical Candor)
    - Gladly work for you again
- 1:1s are extremely important and help to surface topics that don’t normally come up organically
    - Both manager and report should bring topics to discuss to 1:1s
- Be honest and transparent about your report’s performance
    - Your report should have a clear sense at all times of what your expectations are and where he stands.
- Admit your own mistakes and growth areas
- “People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel” - Maya Angelou
- Help people play to their strengths
- “Recognition for hard work, valuable skills, helpful advice, or good values can be hugely motivating if it feels genuine and specific.” - Julie
- Discover what is unique about each person, and capitalize on it
- Make people moves quickly

### Chapter 4 - The Art of Feedback
- For a leader, giving feedback - both when things are going well and when they aren’t - is one of the most fundamental aspects of the job
- When expectations aren’t met, make it clear and don’t wait long to give feedback
- How to ensure your feedback can be acted upon:
    - Make feedback specific and actionable
    - Clarify what success looks and feels like
    - Suggest next steps
        + Beware of overdoing this – empower your team to learn on their own. Think about asking, “So what do you think the net steps should be?” And letting them guide the discussion.
- When delivering bad news about a decision, the decision should be the first thing you say. Own the decision and recognize and disagreement respectfully,

### Chapter 5 -  Managing Yourself

- Everyone feels like an imposter sometimes
- Understand your strengths
- Questions to ask yourself for better self-understanding:
    - Strengths:
        + How would the people who know and like me best (family, SO, friends) describe me? What qualities do I possess that I’m most proud of?
        + When I look back on something I did that was successful, what personal traits do I give credit to?
        + What are the most common pieces of positive feedback that I’ve received from my manager or peers?
    - Weaknesses and triggers:
        + Whenever my worst inner critic sits on my shoulder, what do they yell at me for?
        + If a genie were to between three gifts on me that I don’t currently have, what would they be?
        + What are three things that trigger me?
- What are the top common pieces of feedback ofrom my manager or peers on how I could be more effective?
- Questions to ask your own manager:
    - What opportunities do you see for me to do more of what I do well? What do you think are the biggest things holding me back form having greater impact?
    - What skills do you think a hypothetical perfect person in my role would have? For each skill, how would you rate me against that ideal on a scale of one to five?
- Assume the best of intention from other people
- Visualization is a powerful tool that can help your prepare and provide self-assurance
- Celebrate the little wins
- Take care of yourself – you can’t pour from an empty vessel
- Ask for feedback, and treat your manager as a coach
- Reflect on progress and set goals

### Chapter 6 -  Amazing Meetings
- Good meetings should leave you feeling like it was a good use of time, you learned something new, had clarity, and felt psychologically safe
- Have an ideal meeting outcome, not just a purpose for the meeting
- A good decision-making meeting should get a decision made (duh), include there right stakeholders, present options (and a recommendation if there is one), and give time for dissenting opinions
- Avoid meetings that could be substituted by email
- Meetings have advantages like interactivity (great for things like potentially controversial announcements where discussions would be helpful) and interesting (people pay more attention)
- Great informational meetings enable the group to feel like they learned something, are communicated clearly, are engaging, and evoke emotion
- Great feedback meetings get everyone on the same page, accurately represent the situation, and ends with next steps
- Great idea-generating meetings should create many ideas from individuals that have time to brainstorm alone and then as a group, consider all ideas, not just the loudest ones, build on ideas through meaningful discussion, and end with clear next steps
- Nurture team trust and empathy through shared activities that create better understanding between individuals, encourage openness, and make people feel cared for
- “You’re more likely to have a great meeting if everyone necessary, and nobody extraneous is there.”
- Allow people to prep for meetings by sending out slides and docs in advance - then follow up the meeting with a summary and next steps
- Create a psychologically safe environment for meetings
- Look for meetings you can strike off your calendar or decrease in frequency
