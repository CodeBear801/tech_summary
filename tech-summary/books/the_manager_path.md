- <span style="color:#0000FF">&#9632;</span> Suggestions for speeding up shipping code and delivery iteration
   + Use strategy similar as debugging slow software system
       * Too many alerts or incidents that are causing the team to spend a lot of time firefighting?
       * Projects that are unclear or poorly specified?
       * Developer tools that don’t work well, slow builds, painful release processes, or other bottlenecks that slow down the act of writing code?
   + Understanding more about the team -> dig deeper
       *  Are there personality conflicts among team members that are causing tension?
       *  Is the team bogged down in a bunch of pointless meetings or bureaucracy? 
       *  Do they feel like their ideas aren’t being heard and demotivated by a culture that expects them to just churn out code without listening to the team’s feedback on what they could be working on? 


- <span style="color:#0000FF">&#9632;</span> Suggestions for new manager
   + Spend time getting to know your new team as individuals.  Team is important than project and technique.
   + Spend time to figure out what the group needs most from you.  Don't be anxious to manage.
