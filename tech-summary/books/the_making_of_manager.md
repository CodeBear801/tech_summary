## Giving and Receiving Feedback

Best feedback from her manager - "I have a sense you care more about things are going than you care about me"  
give feedback must have a result -> result in behavior change-> changes your life positively  

Great feedback is always contextual and built on a foundation of trust  

Different kind of feedback
- (clear) expectation
- Task specific feedback
  + emphasis good part immediately
  + help them find their strength
- behaviour feedback
  + feedback about career, probation, strength
- 360 degree feedback

Make your feedback practise
- am I giving feedback often enough
- is my feedback being heard
- lead to positive action?
- am I asking for enough feedback


Delivering critical or difficult feedback
- remind yourself why this matters: feedback is a gift
- what is the most effective way for the feedback to be heard (A different person he trusted?)
- Tell it straight.  No sandwiches
- Remain curious about other perspectives.  It's ok to express your own vulnerability.  (give others a chance to express feelings)
