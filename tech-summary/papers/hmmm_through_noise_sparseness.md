# Hidden Markov Map Matching Through Noise and Sparseness


## Problem

Purely geometric approaches' issue: sensitive to measurement noise and sampling rate.  
Compare with HMM solve this problem by explicitly modeling the connectivity of the raods and considering many different path hypotheses simultaneously.
